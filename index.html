        <p>So this more detailed description. I should talk about me. Well, currently I am a student enrolled at the Liberal Arts and Science Academy of Austin Texas. I like to program and play board and video games, namely Magic: the Gathering and Destiny 2. I know how to program fairly well in Java, C#, and Python. I also am at least partly competent in html (clearly), css, and javascript.</p>
