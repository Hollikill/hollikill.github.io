            <p>This paragraph is meant to help you form an idea of me in your head. For some small details, I am 16 years old. Well, currently I am a student enrolled at the Liberal Arts and Science Academy of Austin, Texas. I like to program, and play board and video games, to name some: <i>Magic: the Gathering, Minecraft, Dungeons and Dragons,</i> and <i>Sid Meier's Civilization</i>. I know how to program fairly well in <i>Java, C#,</i> and<i> Python</i>. I also am at least partly competent in <i>HTML, CSS,</i> and <i>Javascript.</i></p>

            <p>I'm not working on much at the moment other than obtaining an education through the Austin public school system... something that might be a little hard with corana-19 floating around, but in my free time i'm working on a first person shooter I like to call 'Item: Child', because the reward currency is fake children</p>

            <p>Most of my code projects that I have made since 2020 I  have published to my <a href="https://github.com/Hollikill" target="blank">github page</a>, but here a <a href="moreWorks.html">list of some</a>.</p>
