                This is my main resource pack, which I originally created for a modpack I was designing and did not release, but eventually shifted into a all-encompassing QoL improvement pack. This single pack covers so many things that I cannot list them all here. Much of the content in this pack is not designed by me, but rather collected by me and cleanly inserted here.
