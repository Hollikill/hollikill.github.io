                A simple profile manager for minecraft mods, fixing a clear design flaw in every loader. It allows you to have multiple mod folders at once without having to make new game directories, syncing worlds, resource packs, and even settings across all profiles. It functions as an unzipplable folder, which once opened can be stored anywhere. This modloader should work with any number of mod loaders install.
