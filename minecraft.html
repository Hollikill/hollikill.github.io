            <p>Welcome to a quick showcase of some amazing content for minecraft that I have collected over the time I have been playing! Give these things a check out. They are all also completely free of charge, letting you improve your experice at your behest.</p>
        </div>

        <div style=" width: 50%; " class="basicBox">
            <p>One of the best changes I think can be made in minecraft is a simple pallete change for the Crimson wood material from the defualt <span style="color:#893859">Blueish-Purple</span> to a more befitting <span style="color:#a82c3c">Red</span>. This texture pack created by me shortly after the release of 1.16 does just that!</p>
            <p>If you want to download this texture pack, it can be found <a href="Red Crimson Wood.zip">here</a></p>
        </div>
        <div style=" width: 50%; " class="basicBox">
            <p>Another great tool to add on to minecraft is one of the best tools I have found on the internet. All around FPS boost, nearing 2x sometimes; smoother lighting, including lighting in hand; and connected glass, something you will never regret seeing.</p>
            <p>If you want to find out more or download this amazing tool, you can go to <a href="optifine.net">optifine.net</a></p>

        <div style=" width: 50%; " class="basicBox">
            <p>When you think of minecraft modding, the thing that comes to most people's head is the Forge modloader. While this <i>is</i> a quality launcher, and does it's job well, it simply cannot compare to the adaptability of the Fabric modloader. Fabric is a modloader designed to be leightweight and easy to update to new versions, created in 1.14. They update to new versions <i>really</i> fast. Like less than a week time even on the biggest stuff. It also has a lot more useful mods that work in the latest versions of minecraft.</p>
            <p>If you want this amazing modloader, look no further than <a href="fabricmc.net">fabricmc.net</a></p>
        </div>
        <div style=" width: 50%; " class="basicBox">
            <p>It may not be the most useful, or the most well fleshed out mod out there, but it sure is up there. The Immersive Portals mod provides a seamless and beutiful atmosphere to your portals, all while improving portal lag. It also provides multi-dimesional branching, such as the nether actually connected to the overworld, and a infinitely repeating world.</p>
            <p>If you want to check this dazzling mod out, go to <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/immersive-portals-mod">this curseforge page</a></p>
        </div>
        <div style=" width: 50%; " class="basicBox">
            <p>One of the hottest utility modes out there, this provides an QoL change to chulker boxes, making it so that you can see them in your inventory. Not a lot to say, but a whole lot to enjoy. You can even use this one in multi-player servers!</p>
            <p>Just go to the mod's <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/shulkerboxtooltip">curseoforge page</a> to download</p>
        </div>
        <div style=" width: 50%; " class="basicBox">
            <p>This fabric mod is possibly the most useful one out there, informational wise. It provides tools to display shapes that show things like slime chunks, spawn and despawn spheres, and genereal info like speed of play, time, location, and biome.</p>
            <p>You can download it <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/minihud">here</a>, but beware - it has dependencies</p>
