            <p>Hi! I'm Hollister Harper Ream, and this is my website. Up here you can see some of the content that I want to show to the world, such as some of the coding project that I have done, some of my hobbies, or some of my favorite game-related content. Feel free to explore!

            Oh, and by the way, these things here --> <span class="spoiler" onclick="reveal(this)">Yep, these</span> <-- can be hovered over or clicked on for more information. <span class="spoiler" onclick="reveal(this)">...but mostly just comments by me.</p>

            <h2>Bio</h2>
            <p>There's not much to tell, but I'll say what I can about myself. I am a 16 year old male living in the great city of Austin, Texas. I find myself leaning more toward democratic opinions, but no matter what I think, I will be willing to listen to your opinion. Free speech and all! I have a learner's permit for driving, but I don't like to drive. What can I say? Bikes are just better. I am a sophomore at a magnet school <span class="spoiler" onclick="reveal(this)">which is just a public school with a harder application process</span> called Liberal Arts and Science Academy, or LASA for short. They don't allow a lot of electives, but I am taking the third year level of computer science, which is one of my favorite topics along with mathematics. I like to play and make games in almost all forms <span class="spoiler" onclick="reveal(this)">not gaseous!</span>. Some of my favorite games include <i>Magic: the Gathering, Minecraft, D&D,</i> and <i>Sid Meier's Civ</i>. Speaking of programming, I know how to program at an average level in <i>Java, C#,</i> and <i>Python</i>... And, pretty clearly, since I made this site from scratch, <i>HTML</i> and <i>CSS</i>. <span class="spoiler" onclick="reveal(this)">Only a little <i>JavaScript</i> so far</span>. I really love reading books too! <span class="spoiler" onclick="reveal(this)">Usually around 7 or so books a week</span>. Speaking of, my favorite book series is <i>Cradle</i> <span class="spoiler" onclick="reveal(this)">it's really dang good</span>. On sports, I used to play some competitive sports <span class="spoiler" onclick="reveal(this)">swimming and, later, water polo</span>, but I still excersise more often than not.</p>

            <h2>Status</h2>
            <p>I'm not working on much at the moment other than obtaining an education through the Austin public school system... something that might be a little hard with corana-19 floating around, but in my free time I'm... well... bascially just doing school at the moment. I think if I do embark on a project, it'll a 3D 3rd person boss battle game.</p>

            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <p>Some of my school code projects go onto my github page, but most of the ones I work on in my free time I have to upload through google drive. All can be found on my <a href="../html/moreWorks.html">projects</a> page.</p>
