                <br/><br/>
                One of the best changes I think can be made in minecraft is a simple pallete change for the Crimson wood material from the defualt <b style="color:#893859">Blueish-Purple</b> to a more befitting <b style="color:#a82c3c">Red</b>. This texture pack created by me shortly after the release of 1.16 does just that!

                <br/><br/>
                I also recommend my self-designed UI centered resource pack <span class="spoiler" onclick="reveal(this)">Just means only the UI is retextured</span>, which features predominantly square shapes with vibrant colors to complement the existing asthetic.

                Another great tool to add on to minecraft is one of the best tools I have found on the internet. All around FPS boost, nearing 2x sometimes <span class="spoiler" onclick="reveal(this)">No kidding here. It can literally double FPS</span>; smoother lighting, including lighting in hand; and connected glass, something you will never regret seeing.

                <br/><br/>
                When you think of minecraft modding, the thing that comes to most people's heads is the Forge modloader. While this <i>is</i> a quality launcher, and does its job well, it simply cannot compare to the adaptability and updatability of the Fabric modloader. <span class="spoiler" onclick="reveal(this)"> Although the documentation for writing mods is... less then many would like.</span> Fabric is a modloader designed to be leightweight and easy to update to new versions, and it acomplishes it.

                <br/><br/>
                It may not be the most useful, or the fastest running out mod out there, but it sure is up there. The Immersive Portals mod provides a <span class="spoiler" onclick="reveal(this)">well, not literally,</span> seamless and beutiful atmosphere to your portals, all while improving portal lag. It also provides multi-dimesional branching, such as the nether actually connected to the overworld, and a infinitely repeating world. <span class="spoiler" onclick="reveal(this)">These connect through the build limit on the ceiling and the floor. VERY COOL.</span>

                <a href="" target="blank">Shulker Box Tooltip</a>
                <br/><br/>
                One of the hottest utility modes out there, this provides an QoL change to shulker boxes, making it so that you can see them in your inventory. Not a lot to say, but a whole lot to enjoy. You can even use this one in multi-player servers! <span class="spoiler" onclick="reveal(this)">...as opposed to literally only immersive portals.</span>

                This fabric mod is possibly the most useful one out there, informational wise. It provides tools to display shapes that show things like slime chunks, spawn and despawn spheres, and genereal info like speed of play, time, location, and biome. <span class="spoiler" onclick="reveal(this)">Be aware: this mod has dependencies.</span>
